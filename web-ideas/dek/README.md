Dekadin is the name of a character from Oracle of Ages.

He's a little ... unhappy? I don't know. In any case, his house really stuck in my mind. So I'll use him to fuel some personal effort. :P

This was really intended to be the "simplest" javascript thing possible, but... now I'm getting all wrapped up in require, node modules, classes, objects, es6, and I think I'm happy with that.

Also, yes, I'm probably not the best at writing code.
