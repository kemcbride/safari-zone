Did you try the
SAFARI GAME? Some
POKÃ©MON can only
be caught there.


SAFARI ZONE has a
zoo in front of
the entrance.

Mostly just a place for me to play around with little ideas that don't warrant their own repo...

- love2dfun: obviously just little things using love2d and lua for fun. pretty old.
 - this makes use of [middleclass.lua](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass) (go check it out)
- web-ideas: little web ideas that are WAY too small to warrant even their own repo altogether.

I'm sure there might be more in the future.
