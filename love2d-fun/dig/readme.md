# dig.md

### my greatest creation, ever!

Since this is made using love2d, here's instructions to zip it into a love file.
`zip -9 -r dig.love .`


It's just a little animation of a diglett. But, I made it all myself!

### TODO:
- maybe make a makefile, to compile it into an executable / .love file
- change it from being a shitty, very shitty, state machine, into something more...tolerable
